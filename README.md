# helix gruvbox community

This theme is just an extension of the default helix theme: \
`github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/runtime/themes/gruvbox.toml`
that changes some small things to make it look more like the vim theme: \
`github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox`

# setup

To use the plugin you can create a file in `.config/themes/{filename}.toml` and paste the content in it. \
My setup it's using stow so I clone the repo inside `.config/themes/custom/` and the just run `stow helix_gruvbox_community`
